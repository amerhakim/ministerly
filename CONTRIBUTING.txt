CONTRIBUTING TO CLASSERA EMS
============================

Classera EMS is built on proven open source technology and is a result of 
contributions from many people around the world including staff from ministries
of education, teachers, designers, developers, testers, translators and other 
stakeholders. 

You are very welcome to join us and contribute to the project. There are many 
ways you can help, not only with coding.

Classera EMS is open to community code contributions, though all code must go
through design reviews, code reviews, manual testing, integration testing,
and automated testing.

Please contact support@classera.com for further information on contributing to Classera EMS.
